**Goal Creation:**
- **Goal Type:** (long, medium, short)
  - Long: Annual
  - Medium: Monthly
  - Short: Weekly
- **Goal Name**
- **Goal Completion Date:** (exact date required, and if set for more than 1 year later, the goal type turns to long-term. If 3 months later, it turns to medium-term.)
- **Periods to work on this goal:** (daily, weekly, monthly. Each type specifies how often work occurs, either by count or time. e.g., 1 hour per day or twice a week)
- **Period Dates:** optional
- **Period Reminder:** (which days of the week, month, or year and at what time should this period be reminded.)
- **Goal Connection:** optional: what goal does this help to accomplish? For example, the annual goal is to learn English. The weekly goal is to memorize 20 words a day. The annual goal is added as a "goal connection" in the weekly goal.
